Here are a bunch of password protected files for the purpose of being broken open. There also some network device passwords to play with too.

The password that protects them is not complex, and armed with the right tools should be easy to crack and is the same password for all files.

These files are purely for your own personal self-training and study to help learn how to use cracking tools.

Most files have a 'flag' with some text in it. If you manage to crack each file, you'll find the flag quite easily.
(Cisco Type 7 and Juniper Type 9 don't have a flag).
