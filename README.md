Here are a bunch of password protected files for the purpose of being broken open.
The password that protects them is not complex, and armed with the right tools should be easy to crack and is the same for all files.

These files are purely for your own personal self-training and study learning how to use cracking tools.

Most files have a 'flag' with some text in it. If you manage to crack the each file, you'll find the flag quite easily.
(Cisco Type 7 and Juniper Type 9 don't have a flag).
